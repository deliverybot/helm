# Helm Action

Deploys a helm chart using GitHub actions. Supports canary deployments and
provides a built in helm chart for apps that listen over http to get your ramped
up quickly.

View an example repository using this action at
[github.com/deliverybot/example-helm](https://github.com/deliverybot/example-helm).

## Parameters

### Inputs

Inputs below are additionally loaded from the payload of the deployment event
payload if the action was triggered by a deployment.

- `release`: Helm release name. Will be combined with track if set. (required)
- `namespace`: Kubernetes namespace name. (required)
- `chart`: Helm chart path. If set to "app" this will use the built in helm
  chart found in this repository. (required)
- `chart_version`: The version of the helm chart you want to deploy (distinct from app version)
- `values`: Helm chart values, expected to be a YAML or JSON string.
- `track`: Track for the deployment. If the track is not "stable" it activates
  the canary workflow described below.
- `task`: Task name. If the task is "remove" it will remove the configured helm
  release.
- `dry-run`: Helm dry-run option.
- `token`: Github repository token. If included and the event is a deployment
  then the deployment_status event will be fired.
- `value-files`: Additional value files to apply to the helm chart. Expects a
  JSON encoded array or a string.
- `secrets`: Secret variables to include in value file interpolation. Expects a
  JSON encoded map.
- `helm`: Helm binary to execute, one of: [`helm`, `helm3`].
- `version`: Version of the app, usually commit sha works here.
- `timeout`: specify a timeout for helm deployment
- `repository`: specify the URL for a helm repo to come from
- `atomic`: If true, upgrade process rolls back changes made in case of failed upgrade. Defaults to true.

Additional parameters: If the action is being triggered by a deployment event
and the `task` parameter in the deployment event is set to `"remove"` then this
action will execute a `helm delete $service`

#### Versions

- `helm`: v2.16.1
- `helm3`: v3.5.2

### Environment

- `KUBECONFIG_FILE`: Kubeconfig file for Kubernetes cluster access.

### Value file interpolation

The following syntax allows variables to be used in value files:

- `${{ secrets.KEY }}`: References secret variables passed in the secrets input.
- `${{ deployment }}`: References the deployment event that triggered this
  action.

## Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on: ['deployment']

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: 'Deploy'
      uses: 'deliverybot/helm@v1'
      with:
        release: 'nginx'
        namespace: 'default'
        chart: 'app'
        token: '${{ github.token }}'
        values: |
          name: foobar
        value-files: >-
        [
          "values.yaml", 
          "values.production.yaml"
        ]
      env:
        KUBECONFIG_FILE: '${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}'
```

## Example canary

If a track is chosen that is equal to canary, this updates the helm chart
in a few ways:

1. Release name is changed to `{release}-{track}` (eg. myapp-canary).
2. The service is disabled on the helm chart `service.enabled=false`
3. The ingress is disabled on the helm chart `ingress.enabled=false`

Not enabling the service or ingress allows the stable ingress and service
resources to pick up the canary pods and route traffic to them.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on: ['deployment']

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: 'Deploy'
      uses: 'deliverybot/helm@v1'
      with:
        release: 'nginx'
        track: canary
        namespace: 'default'
        chart: 'app'
        token: '${{ github.token }}'
        values: |
          name: foobar
      env:
        KUBECONFIG_FILE: '${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}'
```

## Example pr cleanup

If you are creating an environment per pull request with Helm you may have the
issue where pull request environments like `pr123` sit around in your cluster.
By using GitHub actions we can clean those up by listening for pull request
close events.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml
name: PRCleanup
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - name: 'Deploy'
      uses: 'deliverybot/helm@v1'
      with:
        # Task remove means to remove the helm release.
        task: 'remove'
        release: 'review-myapp-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}'
        version: '${{ github.sha }}'
        track: 'stable'
        chart: 'app'
        namespace: 'example-helm'
        token: '${{ github.token }}'
      env:
        KUBECONFIG_FILE: '${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}'
```
